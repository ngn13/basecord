# Basecord - A discord bot framework
Basecord is a nextcord based discord bot framework written in
python. It has different built-in functions making it easier
to develop large-scaled and medium-scaled bots.

I will be creating a wiki really soon, for now you can
see the [template project](https://github.com/ngn13/basecord-template)
to understand how you can make your own bot with it.

### Install
```
pip install -U https://github.com/ngn13/basecord/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

### Create a project
```
basecord <project_name>
```
